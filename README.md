# Turing Machine

Alan Turing's concept of a Turing Machine is one of a theoretical computer (state machine) which can complete any task given an intial state, position, tape, and set of tuples (rules). 

Tuples are formated in the following way
[currentState input newState output direction]
- currentState is the state of the machine, positive integer
- input is a character
- newState is the next state of the machine, positive integer
- output is a character that replaces the current position in the tape
- direction is either left or right
